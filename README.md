# C++ Grade Calculator

A beginner-level console-based C++ application that calculates weighted GPA
based on major, minor, and other courses.

## Overview
This project was created to practice core C++ concepts such as functions,
loops, conditional statements, and user input handling.  
The program allows users to calculate their overall GPA and corresponding
letter grade through a menu-driven interface.

## Features
- Menu-driven console interface
- Weighted GPA calculation
- Letter grade conversion (A, B, C, D, F)
- Modular function-based structure
- Beginner-friendly C++ implementation

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Standard Library (`iostream`)

## How It Works
1. User selects an option from the menu
2. Inputs course grades and credits
3. Program calculates the weighted GPA
4. Outputs numerical GPA and letter grade

## Purpose
This project is part of my learning journey in C++ and software development.
It demonstrates my ability to build a complete working program from scratch
and apply fundamental programming concepts.
